Install
=======

Get the gem

  sudo gem install method_lister

Open up `~/.irbrc` and add these lines:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'method_lister'
    
Usage
=====

Method Lister is used to query objects and discover which ancestor implements
which methods. It's quite common to have a lot of mixins and several classes
in an object's class hierarchy, especially in a Rails application. To help
with this Method Lister adds the ability to find out in which classes/modules
the methods on an object are implemented.

Method Lister adds 3 methods to all objects in the system: `ls`, `grep`, and
`which`. Since these names are sometimes taken you can also use `mls`,
`mgrep`, and `mwhich`.  

Method Lister is intended to be used from IRB or during debugging.

`ls` or `mls`
-------------

The `ls` command will list all methods an object responds to, organized by the
module or class which provides the implementation. For example (results may
vary, depending on what you have loaded):

    >> [].ls
    ========== Module Kernel ==========
    == === =~ __id__ __send__ class clone display dup eql? equal? extend
    freeze frozen? gem grep hash id inspect instance_eval instance_of?
    instance_variable_defined? instance_variable_get instance_variable_set
    instance_variables is_a? kind_of? ls method methods mgrep mls mwhich nil?
    object_id pretty_inspect private_methods protected_methods public_methods
    require respond_to? send singleton_methods taint tainted? to_a to_s type
    untaint which

    ========== Module PP::ObjectMixin ==========
    pretty_print pretty_print_cycle pretty_print_inspect
    pretty_print_instance_variables

    ========== Module Enumerable ==========
    all? any? collect detect each_with_index entries find find_all grep
    include? inject map max member? min partition reject select sort sort_by
    to_a zip

    ========== Class Array ==========
    & * + - << <=> == [] []= assoc at clear collect collect! compact compact!
    concat delete delete_at delete_if each each_index empty? eql? fetch fill
    first flatten flatten! frozen? hash include? index indexes indices insert
    inspect join last length map map! nitems pack pop pretty_print
    pretty_print_cycle push rassoc reject reject! replace reverse reverse!
    reverse_each rindex select shift size slice slice! sort sort! to_a to_ary
    to_s transpose uniq uniq! unshift values_at zip |
    
`grep` or `mgrep`
-----------------

The `grep` command takes a regular expression and only returns methods which
match the given regex. In this example we'll use `mgrep` since on Array
objects `grep` is already taken:

    >> [].mgrep /f/
    ========== Module Kernel ==========
    freeze frozen? instance_of? instance_variable_defined? kind_of?

    ========== Module Enumerable ==========
    find find_all

    ========== Class Array ==========
    delete_if fetch fill first flatten flatten! frozen? shift unshift
    
NOTE: `method_missing` is always considered a match

`which` or `mwhich`
-------------------

The `which` command is for finding which classes or modules implement the
method you're seeking.

    >> [].which :to_a
    ========== Module Kernel ==========
    to_a

    ========== Module Enumerable ==========
    to_a

    ========== Class Array ==========
    to_a

NOTE: The `which` command is exactly the same as grep(/^method$/) with the
method name regex escaped.

NOTE: `method_missing` is always considered a match.

MethodLister::Finder
====================

The method finding logic is encapsulated by `MethodLister::Finder`, which has
three public methods: `ls`, `grep`, and `which`. However, instead of printing
to $stdout the finder will return a data structure you can manipulate.
